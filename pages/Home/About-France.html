            <h2 >The Beauty of France</h2>
            <p> You might never have discovered the best of France.
                Behind a touristic and commercial aspect, France has lots of hidden beauty.
                Not only in nature but also in people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from the large and beautiful variety of the natural environment, 
                France has produced a noticeable quality of life. 
                Some call it the Art of Living.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Marked by a certain absence of anxiety, even in the midst of hectic chaos, 
                French character is forged by a natural encounter of opposing forces.
            </p>
        </div>  <!--end col 2 -->

        <div id="img1"class="col-3"><!--col 3 -->
            <img src="../Home/rising-sun-on-hills-612x612.webp" alt="La Provence" class="media-center" height="100%"">

        <div class="col-1"></div> <!--col 4-->

    </div> <!--end row2 -->

    <div id="row3"class="row"> <!--row3 -->
        <div class="col-1"></div><!--col 1-->
        <div class="col-8"> <!--col 2-->

            <p>
                Primitive brute forces, adapted in coexistence, in spite of appearances,
                have found a balance in their constant opposition together. 
                Opposition is a game in France. 
                People have learned to live together with differences and are mostly happy and 
                peaceful. Life is rather self-sufficient. 
                Poor or rich, active or passive, left or right politics, 
                people are pretty well-balanced, even if the appearance doesn't show it so much. 
                Life is a play.
            </p>

            <p>
                At least for the native French people. 
                Those who have genetically inherited the character this land has produced.  
                I am not talking about the large and growing immigrated, "non-French' part of society.
                Many have desired to conquer France over history, collectively and individually. 
                Still today, people from all over the world flow into the country, 
                trying to make it their homeland, longing for a better life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But to integrate these 'out-of-the-box' people, 
                deeper cultural understanding and perseverance are needed.
                Social and hospitable as they are, the French usually want to help people,
                but most immigrants though, will have difficulty to truly come to understand 
                the life and the culture in this country.

            <h2 >The Difference</h2>
            <p>
                Common life in France paints another picture than the overall competitive Anglo-American, 
                North European or Asian societies, where generally a severe survival battle claims its price. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Things like performance pressure, goals to attain, obligations and responsbilities to assure, make most people's lives a never-ending, 
                stressful race to beat the competition. This way of living claims high tolls, usually called 
                stress and anxiety. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The bottom line is this: <strong>"We don't have it, and we stress to get it.” </strong>
                Whatever "it' means to live peacefully.
            </p>
            <p>
                The excellence of France I suggest doesn't need that kind of pressure. 
                Aiming to become the number one doesn't work so much here. Winning is not that important.
                Less than what I have seen in other cultures. It has a sense of wisdom and maturity. 
                Beating the competition doesn't last very long in life. 
                But to find authenticity and acceptance will do a better job, 
                in reaching longterm satisfaction.

            <h2 >Daily life</h2>
            <p>
                In France one can usually find the balance needed to be fulfilled. 
                Generally, life is prosperous for people willing to work.
                Mainstream society has disciplined habits, a healthy daily rhythm and a good measure of satisfaction 
                and happiness. There is reasonable social and financial freedom, with help and opportunities. 
                People are mostly qualified and faithful in their work and fast runners will get 
                frustrated quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Top performance doesn't come from being fast and beating the competition. It is cultivated 
                by diligently, patiently laboring on skill and quality work. With peace of mind.
                France is expressive and artistic. Peace, which is the absence of anxiety, 
                is a crucial ingredient for the success of any artist. Success is guaranteed 
                if one knows how to let time perfect his work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Globally, French people are quite characteristic and out of the box. Expressive. 
                They may seem to come from another planet sometimes. You may wonder what point of view 
                they are coming from. For a good part of people, logic is not their strong. Intuïtion is. 
                This can be very frustrating for foreigners. 
                It is never easy to understand how they tick. 
                But enriching and fascinating to discover, iF we're open for surprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I started to let go of my “Dutch/Germanic” educational concepts, after quite some years, 
                I became more “French”. I discovered a new and fascinating way of viewing life. 
                With peace, inspiration and riches. It made me more happy and better balanced. 
                A valuable lesson the French taught me. Something I'd never seen in Holland.
                But I have no clue if they know what I am talking about. For them it is just normal.
