            <h2 >The Beauty of France</h2>
            <p> You might never have discovered the best of France.
                Behind a touristic and commercial aspect, France has lots of hidden beauty.
                Not only in nature but also in people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from the large and beautiful variety of the natural environment, 
                France has produced a noticeable quality of life. 
                Some call it the Art of Living.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Marked by a certain absence of anxiety, even in the midst of hectic chaos, 
                French character is forged by a natural encounter of opposing forces.
            </p>

            <p>
                Primitive brute forces, adapted in coexistence, in spite of appearances,
                have found a balance in their constant opposition together. 
                Opposition is a game in France. 
                People have learned to live together with differences and are mostly happy and 
                peaceful. Life is self-sufficient. 
                Poor or rich, active or passive, left or right politics, 
                people are rather well-balanced, even if appearance doesn't show. 
                Opposing others is a game.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am not talking about a large and growing immigrated, "non-French' part of society.
                I talk about the native French people. 
                Those who have genetically inherited the character this land has produced. 
                Many have desired to conquer France over history, collectively and individually. 
                Still today, people from all over the world flow into the country, 
                trying to make it their homeland, longing for a better life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But to integrate these 'out-of-the-box' people, 
                deeper cultural understanding and perseverance are needed.
                Social and hospitable as they are, the French want to help people. 
                But most immigrants though, will hardly ever truly come to understand 
                the life and the culture of this country.
            </p>

            <h2 >The Difference in France</h2>
            <p>
                Common life in France paints another picture than the overall competitive Anglo-American, 
                North European or Asian societies, where generally a severe survival battle claims its price. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Things like performance pressure, goals to attain, obligations and responsbilities to assure, make most people's lives a never-ending, 
                stressful race to beat the competition. This way of living claims high tolls, usually called 
                stress and anxiety. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The bottom line is this: <strong>"We don't have it, and we stress to get it.‚Äù </strong><br>
                Whatever "it' means to live peacefully.
            </p>
            <p>
                The excellence of France I suggest doesn't need that kind of pressure. 
                Aiming to become the number one doesn't work here. Winning is not that important. 
                Beating the competition doesn't last. Authenticity and acceptance do.
            </p>

            <h2 >The Daily life</h2>
            <p>
                In France one can find the balance needed to be fulfilled. Generally, life is prosperous.
                Mainstream society has disciplined habits, a daily rhythm and a good measure of satisfaction 
                and happiness. There is reasonable social and financial freedom, with help and opportunities. 
                People are mostly qualified and faithful in their work and fast runners will get 
                frustrated quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Top performance doesn't come from being fast and beating the competition. It is cultivated 
                by diligently and patiently laboring on quality work. With peace of mind.
                France is rather expressive and artistic. Peace, the absence of anxiety, 
                is a crucial ingredient for the success of any artist. If he knows how to patiently let 
                nature perfect his work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Globally, French people are quite characteristic and out of the box. Expressive. 
                They may seem to come from another planet sometimes. You may wonder what point of view 
                they are coming from. Logic is not their strong point. Intu√Øtion is. This can be very 
                frustrating for  foreigners. It is not always easy to understand how they tick. 
                But enriching and fascinating to discover, IF we're open for some surprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I started to let go of my ‚ÄúDutch Germanic‚Äù educational concepts, after many years, 
                I became more ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù. I discovered a new and fascinating way of living my life. 
                With peace. It made me happy and better balanced. But I have no clue if French people 
                know what I am talking about.
